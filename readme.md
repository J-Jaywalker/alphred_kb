# Alphred Firmware

Firmware for the **Alphred**, a custom-built CRKBD 6-column, 42-key split keyboard. This is the second iteration of the original *Alph* firmware, which powered the first version of the build. Alphred V2 aims to improve upon the original in terms of functionality, maintainability and user experience.

The firmware is built using [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/), a modern firmware platform for wireless mechanical keyboards. For further details on syntax and configuration behavior, refer to the [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs).

> **Why "Alphred"?**  
> This V2 build features red-colored PCBs, giving rise to the portmanteau *Alph + red* ‚Üí *Alphred*. Could‚Äôve been *Ralph* for "Red Alph", honestly. Either is good tbh.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

### `config/corne.keymap`
Defines the keyboard layout, key bindings, behaviors (e.g. hold-tap, layers, macros), and other input logic for the Corne build.

#### Configuring Keymaps

Keymaps can be configured manually by modifying `corne.keymap`, but in most cases it's easier to use the [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) made by Nick Coutsos, providing it has permissions to run on your repo. 

### `config/corne.conf`
ZMK configuration file that controls lower-level keyboard behavior such as debounce timing, power management, and feature toggles.

### `build.yaml`
Specifies build targets for multiple board and hardware configurations. Examples include:

- **MCUs:** `nice_nano_v2`, `rp2040_pro_micro`
- **Displays:** `nice_oled`, `nice_epaper`

Customize these to generate specific firmware builds for each half or hardware variant.

### `west.yaml`
Controls dependency and module management via [west](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html). It pulls in the main ZMK repo, along with any plugins or shield adapters required for the Alphred firmware.

### `.github/workflows/build.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow that automatically compiles build artifacts on push or PR. Outputs firmware binaries for each configured target in `build.yaml`.

## ü™≤ Configuring Beedly

On the right hand side peripheral, you can see the Beedly the beetle Tamagotchi.
You can configure dithering for the animation by setting:
`CONFIG_NICE_BEETLE_DITHER_BEEDLY=y` to `conf/corne.conf`

Check out my forked [zmk-nice-beetle](https://github.com/J-Jaywalker/zmk-nice-beetle) repo for more info.

## üß™ Building Locally

To build the firmware locally (make sure you have the relevant compilers first):

```bash
west build -s zmk/app -d build/left -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=corne_left -DZMK_CONFIG=config
```
Adjust SHIELD and BOARD as needed for your hardware and layout.
